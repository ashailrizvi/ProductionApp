# Assets Directory

This directory is for optional branding assets:

## PDF Branding Images (Optional)

### letterhead.png
- **Purpose**: Company letterhead for PDF invoices
- **Recommended Size**: 800x200 pixels

### stamp.png  
- **Purpose**: Company stamp/seal for PDF invoices
- **Recommended Size**: 200x200 pixels

## How to Add Branding

1. Create your letterhead and stamp images
2. Save them as `letterhead.png` and `stamp.png`
3. Upload them to this `assets/` directory
4. The PDF generator will automatically include them

## Graceful Fallback

If these files are not present:
- PDFs will generate normally without branding
- No errors will occur
- Professional layout is maintained

This provides flexibility for teams that want basic functionality without custom branding.
