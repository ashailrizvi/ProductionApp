    - **Solution**: Updated modal z-index to z-[60] for both invoice and quotation preview modals to ensure they appear above loading overlays
    - **Comprehensive Fixes Applied**: Function accessibility, template loading, event binding improvements, and z-index hierarchy

### üîß Technical Architecture

**Recent Critical Fix: Invoice Preview Independence**
- **Problem**: Invoice preview buttons required visiting quotations page first to work properly
- **Root Cause**: The invoice and quotation preview modals were nested inside the hidden quotations page container; when navigating directly to invoices, the hidden ancestor prevented the modal from showing. There was also implicit reliance on data that might not have been loaded yet.
- **Solution**: Moved both preview modals to the global root of the DOM (outside page containers), and added a runtime guard that re-parents the invoice/quotation modals to `document.body` if ever found under a hidden page. Retained dependency checks to load services/bundles/customers/templates when needed.
- **Implementation**:
  - Relocated `#invoice-preview-modal` and `#quotation-preview-modal` out of `#page-quotations` into a global section at the bottom of `index.html`.
  - Added re-parenting safety in `showInvoicePreview` and `showQuotationPreview` to ensure independence from page visibility state.
  - Minor cleanup in `previewInvoice` to remove duplicate dependency checks.
- **Files Modified**: `index.html`, `js/invoices.js`, `js/quotations.js`
